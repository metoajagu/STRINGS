# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

 catalog topic: My catalog website will be a guitar catalog where players can sell and buy guitars.

 why is this a _cohesive_ audience?

 This audience is cohesive because it targets the individuals who play and love guitar but can also target to the more broader music-loving audience.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.

> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: To buy/search/sell a new/used guitar

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include pictures and valid descriptions of each item.
  - Align the images and descriptions neatly.

  - Include Usernames, as well as guitar reviews for every guitar model on the site.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By adding usernames, comments/reviews it shows the user that their is someone who shares their interest and not just a random company telling them something.

Goal 3: Learn more about specific guitar models

- Incorporate useful and concise knowledge on each guitar model displayed on the catalog
  - Rationale: this gives th user a clear description of what they are looking to potentially buy
- Highlight/Bolden the important specs and features of each guitar model
  - Rationale: Clearly indicating the most important features of the model allows the user to have all the information needed to make a purchase decision.
